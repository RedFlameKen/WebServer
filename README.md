# WebServer
This is a custom web server that will be used for a school project in SOFTENG2.
This project aims to immitate an http protocol server.

## Building
to build the project, just use the wrapper gradle file:

on Linux:
```
./gradlew build
```

on Windows:
```
gradle.bat build
```

## Running 
Since this project uses gradle, It would be much easier to run the project
through the gradle wrapper script.

on Linux:
```
./gradlew run
```

on Windows:
```
gradle.bat run
```

## Totally Valid Questions
> Why make this when you could just use an existing http server?
- Cuz yes. jk, this allows the backend person (me) to have more control over
  how the flow of data works. Also I have no experience with http yet so I'll
  just make this instead.
